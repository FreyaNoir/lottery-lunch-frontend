# Lottery Lunch Project

This is the repository containing the frontend for the Lottery Lunch Project, done within the context of the Shortcut React Club. The backend can be found on [this repository](https://github.com/trachanh1609/shortcut-lottery-lunch).

## Project description

The Lottery Lunch, organized by the Shortcut, is an opportunity for participants to meet one another. Every month, people get matched with a random person from the program, and go have lunch or coffe together.

The goal of our project is to automate this process.
To do so, we have decided to build a platform for both participants and administrators.

### User features:

-   Login (either with email/password, or with Google).
-   View match of the month + previous matches.
-   "Active/inactive" button to be taken out of the list if not available.

### Administrator features:

-   Login as admin.
-   View all previous matches.
-   Automatically create pairs when needed. The same pairs cannot be repeated.
-   Possibility to manually override a pair.
-   Once the pairs have been created, an email should be sent automatically to all participants. The content should be customizable, but we can start with a general template.
-   Access to participants' information (email, comments, active status, etc.)
